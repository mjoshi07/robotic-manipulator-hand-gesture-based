# Hand Gesture based Robotic Manipulator
* My undergraduate project, main objective was to design a low cost robotic maniputalor having 2 Degrees of Freedom and a gripping mechanism
* ADXL335 accelerometer was used for moving forward, backward, right and left and for gripper was controlled by a flex sensor.
* All the communication was done wirelessly using RF.
* 2 Arduinos, 1 for transmitter and 1 for receiver were used.
* The complete cost of production was less than Rs. 10000. The arm chassis was manufactured indigenously.
